# de.cmd.crosstab
SAP Design Studio Crosstab Extension that provides conditional formating. 

Crosstabs in SAP Design Studio do not offer conditional formating. This extension should have the same functionality like the standard component crosstab them has, plus additional options concerning the cell formatting. 
The main idea is to provide designers a possibility to format colours within a crosstab under certain conditions. 
The crosstab should have the following functionality: 
	•	Designers should be able format cells and alter values within the additional  properties view. 
	•	Each column of the crosstab should be selectable. 
	•	For each column, designers should be able to set up to five conditions  simultaneously. 
	•	Each condition should have up to 4 operators (more than, less than, equals,  between) and one colour property. 
	•	After clicking the crosstab, additional property should load all selected columns  and inherent conditions. 
	•	All insignificant signs except the positive or negative numbers within the crosstab cells should be filtered out automatically. 
In order to run this extension you need the SAP Design Studio version 1.3 and a proper data source.
